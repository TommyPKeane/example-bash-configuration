# Other `bash`-related Application Configs

As part of a general system setup for development or just for working with `bash`, there's other applications that I tend to use together, like SublimeText and iTerm2 and such.

This directory contains the configuration files to summarize how I would configure those applications, though these files wouldn't necessarily be stored in this same directory/directory-tree in an actual system. That's just to say that I've put the files here out of convenience to keep everything together.

## SublimeText

[SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a commercial application for text and file editing with built-in features for project management, git repo awareness, custom extensions, and syntax highlighting for the majority of contemporary programming languages.

I've been using SublimeText personally, professionally, and academically since 2010 with SublimeText (ST1) through to current versions of SublimeText 4 (ST4).

I've purchased personal licenses for each version, and I also use SublimeMerge (now SublimeMerge 2) with the purchase of the combined license.

At first glance the price for the software may seem like a lot, compared to using VSCode for free, but I've just always preferred the simplicity and extensibility of SublimeText, and the reliability & efficiency that it has provided compared to other similar applications.

This is just my personal preference and I don't mean to sway anyone's opinion or provide any kind of advertisement, I'm just sharing this information in case anyone's curious (unless I know you personally, and then I'll definitely be silently and vocally judging you [_with kindness_] based on your text editor of choice ðŸ‘»).
